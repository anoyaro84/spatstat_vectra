# Multi-scale spatial feature extraction from Vectra data

R script for generating spatial freatures from cellular distribution captured by Vectra data.
The framework is based on marked Poisson point processes, impleted in `spatst` R package.
More details for the theory and its application to Vectra data from Primary Central Nervous Cell lymhoma (PCNSL) can be found [here](!https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.27.509403v1).
